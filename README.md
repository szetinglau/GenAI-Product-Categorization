TODO Update Readme as this might be a highly repeatable solution



TODO Deployable solution idea: Web UI, drop in a file in this format, columns, rows, each even row hasn't been looked at, each odd row is ground truth. Spits out the accuracy of having Azure AI Search + GPT-4o/4o-mini/o1 make the product categorization

TODO Make a One Click Deploy, yes it'll be painful, but do it and you enhance repeatability
