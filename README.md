# pfg-product-categorization

TODO Turn off content filter for this. It triggers maybe once every 100 product items when classifying through gpt-4o: Content filter error: Could not parse response content as the request was rejected by the content filter

TODO Need to spit out each search results + prompt going to GPT-4o for verification purposes

TODO Update Readme as this might be a highly repeatable solution



TODO Deployable solution idea: Web UI, drop in a file in this format, columns, rows, each even row hasn't been looked at, each odd row is ground truth. Spits out the accuracy of having Azure AI Search + GPT-4o/4o-mini/o1 make the product categorization

TODO Make a One Click Deploy, yes it'll be painful, but do it and you enhance repeatability


TODO Test with Blanks on Class
